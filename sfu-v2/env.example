# SFU Server Configuration

# Port for the SFU server
PORT=5005

# STUN servers (comma separated)
STUN_SERVERS=stun:stun.l.google.com:19302

# Pin the UDP port range used for WebRTC media (open/allow this range on the SFU host firewall)
# Example: 200 "seats"
ICE_UDP_PORT_MIN=10000
ICE_UDP_PORT_MAX=10004

# Optional: hard-cap the number of connected peers (defaults to size of ICE_UDP_PORT_* range if set)
# MAX_PEERS=200

# Optional: force the IP address the SFU advertises in ICE host candidates.
# Use this when the SFU is behind NAT or you want to ensure it never advertises an unintended public IP.
# ICE_ADVERTISE_IP=203.0.113.10

# Optional: disable server-side STUN (prevents the SFU from discovering/advertising server-reflexive candidates)
# Useful to avoid leaking a "wrong" public IP when the SFU is not directly reachable there.
# DISABLE_STUN=true

# Debug logging (true/false) - shows detailed room management, connections, signaling

# Verbose logging (true/false) - shows RTP packet forwarding details
